Introduction
============

An alternative *folder_contents* forms, that disable someway KSS ordering and show another fast way
to reorder items (less cool, but this is working most of the time).

Use this only when you (or your users) experience some problem with KSS ordering (not always this happens,
but happens...).

TODO
====

* Some Plone code customized can be not touched, for sure.
* Tests on Plone 4
* Use jQuery Tools features if installed
* Find a KSS way to disable KSS
